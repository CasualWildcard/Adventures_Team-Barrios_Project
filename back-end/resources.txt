HyperOpt
http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/
"Hyperopt's job is to find the best value of a scalar-valued,
possibly-stochastic function over a set of possible arguments to that function.
Whereas many optimization packages will assume that these inputs are drawn from
a vector space, Hyperopt is different in that it encourages you to describe
your search space in more detail. By providing more information about where
your function is defined, and where you think the best values are, you allow
algorithms in hyperopt to search more efficiently."
